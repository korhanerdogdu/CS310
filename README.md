# RateMyProfessorsSabanci
A mobile application where Sabancı University students can rate and comment on their professors

This project was done as a group project in Sabancı's Mobile Programming Course, CS310. The application works as a bridge between students and professors since it provides an opportunity for Sabancı students who want to share their experiences with professors in various courses they have taken. In this repository, you can find the Proposal, Report, and Navigation Diagram of the project alongside two recordings that act as demonstrations for the Backend and Frontend parts of the project.
